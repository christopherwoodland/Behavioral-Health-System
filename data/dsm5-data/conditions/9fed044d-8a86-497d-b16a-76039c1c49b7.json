Eating, In a discrete period of time (e.g., within any 2-hour period), an amount of\nfood that is definitely larger than what most individuals would eat in a similar period\nof time under similar circumstances.\n\n2\\. A sense of lack of control over eating during the episode (e.g., a feeling that one\ncannot stop eating or control what or how much one is eating).\n\nB. Recurrent Inappropriate compensatory behaviors in order to prevent weight gain, such\nas self-Induced vomiting; misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or other medications; fasting;\n\nor excessive exercise.\n\nC. The binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviors both occur, on average,\nat least once a week for 3 months.\n\nD. Self-evaluation is unduly influenced by body shape and weight.\n\nE.

The disorder occurs but is un-\ncommon among obese individuals. Between eating binges, individuals with bulimia ner-\nvosa typically restrict their total caloric consumption and preferentially select low-calorie\n(\u0022diet\u0022) foods while avoiding foods that they perceive to be fattening or likely to trigger a\nbinge.\n\nMenstrual irregularity or amenorrhea often occurs among females with bulimia ner-\nvosa; it is uncertain whether such disturbances are related to weight fluctuations, to nu-\ntritional deficiencies, or to emotional distress. The fluid and electrolyte disturbances\nresulting from the purging behavior are sometimes sufficiently severe to constitute med-\nically serious problems. Rare but potentially fatal complications include esophageal tears,\ngastric rupture, and cardiac arrhythmias. Serious cardiac and skeletal myopathies have\nbeen reported among individuals following repeated use of syrup of ipecac to Induce vom-\niting. Individuals who chronically abuse laxatives may become dependent on their use to\nstimulate bowel movements. Gastrointestinal symptoms are commonly associated with\nbulimia nervosa, and rectal prolapse has also been reported among individuals with this\ndisorder.\n\n\n###",

  "developmentAndCourse": "Bulimia nervosa commonly begins in adolescence or young adulthood. Onset before pu-\nberty or after age 40 is uncommon. The binge eating frequently begins during or after an\nepisode of dieting to lose weight. Experiencing multiple stressful life events also can pre-\ncipitate onset of bulimia nervosa.\n\nDisturbed eating behavior persists for at least several years in a high percentage of\nclinic samples. The course may be chronic or intermittent, with periods of remission\nalternating with recurrences of binge eating. However, over longer-term follow-up, the\nsymptoms of many individuals appear to diminish with or without treatment, although\ntreatment clearly impacts outcome. Periods of remission longer than 1 year are associated\nwith better long-term outcome.\n\nSignificantly elevated",

  "genderRelatedIssues": "Bulimia nervosa is far more common in females than in males. Males are especially under-\nrepresented in treatment-seeking samples, for reasons that have not yet been systemati-\ncally examined.\n\n\n### Diagnostic Markers\n\nNo specific diagnostic test for bulimia nervosa currently exists. However, several labora-\ntory abnormalities may occur as a consequence of purging and may increase diagnostic\ncertainty. These Include fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, such as hypokalemia (which\ncan provoke cardiac arrhythmias), hypochloremia, and hyponatremia. The loss of gastric\nacid through vomiting may produce a metabolic alkalosis (elevated serum bicarbonate),\nand the frequent induction of diarrhea or dehydration through laxative and diuretic abuse\ncan cause metabolic acidosis. Some individuals with bulimia nervosa exhibit mildly ele-\nvated levels of serum amylase, probably reflecting an increase in the salivary isoenzyme.\nPhysical examination usually yields no physical findings. However, Inspection of the\nmouth may reveal significant and permanent loss of dental enamel, especially from lin-\ngual surfaces of the front teeth due to recurrent vomiting. These teeth may become\nchipped and appear ragged and \u0022moth-eaten.\u0022 There may also be an increased frequency\nof dental caries. In some individuals, the salivary glands, particularly the parotid glands,\nmay become notably enlarged. Individuals who induce vomiting by manually stimulating\nthe gag reflex may develop calluses or scars on the dorsal surface of the hand from re-\npeated contact with the teeth. Serious cardiac and skeletal myopathies have been reported\namong individuals following repeated use of syrup of ipecac to induce vomiting.\n\nBulimia Nervosa 349\n\n\n###",

    "Anorexia nervosa, binge-eating/purging type. Individuals whose binge-eating behav-\nlor occurs only during episodes of anorexia nervosa are given the diagnosis anorexia ner-\nvosa, binge-eating/purging type, and should not be given the additional diagnosis of\nbulimia nervosa. For individuals with an initial diagnosis of anorexia nervosa who binge\nand purge but whose presentation no longer meets the full criteria for anorexia nervosa,\nbinge-eating/purging type (e.g., when weight is normal), a diagnosis of bulimia ner-\nvosa should be given only when all criteria for bulimia nervosa have been met for at least\n3months.\n\nBinge-eating disorder. Some individuals binge eat but do not engage in regular inap-\npropriate compensatory behaviors. In these cases, the diagnosis of binge-eating disorder\nshould be considered.\n\nKleine-Levin syndrome. In certain neurological or other medical conditions, such as\nKleine-Levin syndrome, there is disturbed eating behavior, but the characteristic psycho-\nlogical features of bulimia nervosa, such as overconcern with body shape and weight, are\nnot present.\n\nMajor depressive disorder, with atypical features. Overeating is common in major de-\npressive disorder, with atypical features, but individuals with this disorder do not engage\nin Inappropriate compensatory behaviors and do not exhibit the excessive concern with\nbody shape and weight characteristic of bulimia nervosa. If criteria for both disorders are\nmet, both diagnoses should be given.\n\nBorderline personality disorder. Binge-eating behavior is included in the impulsive be-\nhavior criterion that is part of the definition of borderline personality disorder. If the cri-\nteria for both borderline personality disorder and bulimia nervosa are met, both diagnoses\nshould be given."

  "comorbidity": "most experiencing at least one other mental disorder and many experiencing multiple co-\nmorbidities. Comorbidity is not limited to any particular subset but rather occurs across a\nwide range of mental disorders. There is an increased frequency of depressive symptoms\n(e.g., low self-esteem) and bipolar and depressive disorders (particularly depressive dis-\norders) in individuals with bulimia nervosa. In many individuals, the mood disturbance\nbegins at the same time as or following the development of bulimia nervosa, and individ-\nuals often ascribe their mood disturbances to the bulimia nervosa. However, In some in-\ndividuals, the mood disturbance clearly precedes the development of bulimia nervosa.\nThere may also be an increased frequency of anxiety symptoms (e.g., fear of social situa-\ntions) or anxiety disorders. These mood and anxiety disturbances frequently remit follow-\n350 Feeding and Eating Disorders\n\ning effective treatment of the bulimia nervosa. The lifetime prevalence of substance use,\nparticularly alcohol or stimulant use, is at least 30% among individuals with bulimia ner-\nvosa.
