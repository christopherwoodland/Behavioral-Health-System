  "associatedFeatures": "Individuals with dissociative identity disorder typically present with comorbid depression,\nanxiety, substance abuse, self-injury, non-epileptic seizures, or another common symp-\ntom. They often conceal, or are not fully aware of, disruptions in consciousness, amnesia,\nor other dissociative symptoms. Many Individuals with dissociative identity disorder re-\nport dissociative flashbacks during which they undergo a sensory reliving of a previous\nevent as though it were occurring in the present, often with a change of identity, a partial\nor complete loss of contact with or disorientation to current reality during the flashback,\nand a subsequent amnesia for the content of the flashback. Individuals with the disorder\ntypically report multiple types of interpersonal maltreatment during childhood and adult-\nhood. Nonmaltreatment forms of overwhelming early life events, such as multiple long,\npainful, early-life medical procedures, also may be reported. Self-mutilation and suicidal\nbehavior are frequent. On standardized measures, these individuals report higher levels\nof hypnotizability and dissociativity compared with other clinical groups and healthy con-\ntrol subjects. Some individuals experience transient psychotic phenomena or episodes.\nSeveral brain regions have been implicated in the pathophysiology of dissociative identity\ndisorder, including the orbitofrontal cortex, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and\namygdala.\n\n\n###",

  "developmentAndCourse": "Dissociative identity disorder is associated with overwhelming experiences, traumatic\nevents, and/or abuse occurring in childhood. The full disorder may first manifest at al-\nmost any age (from earliest childhood to late life). Dissociation in children may generate\nproblems with memory, concentration, attachment, and traumatic play. Nevertheless, chil-\ndren usually do not present with identity changes; instead they present primarily with over-\nlap and interference among mental states (Criterion A phenomena), with symptoms related\nto discontinuities of experience. Sudden changes in identity during adolescence may ap-\npear to be just adolescent turmoil or the early stages of another mental disorder. Older\nIndividuals may present to treatment with what appear to be late-life mood disorders, ob-\nsessive-compulsive disorder, paranola, psychotic mood disorders, or even cognitive dis-\norders due to dissociative amnesia.

  "cultureRelatedIssues": "Many features of dissociative identity disorder can be influenced by the individual\u0027s cul-\ntural background. Individuals with this disorder may present with prominent medically\nunexplained neurological symptoms, such as non-epileptic seizures, paralyses, or sensory\nloss, in cultural settings where such symptoms are common. Similarly, in settings where\nnormative possession is common (e.g., rural areas in the developing world, among certain\nreligious groups in the United States and Europe), the fragmented identities may take the\nform of possessing spirits, delties, demons, animals, or mythical figures. Acculturation or\nprolonged intercultural contact may shape the characteristics of the other identities (e.g.,\nIdentities in India may speak English exclusively and wear Western clothes). Possession-\nform dissociative identity disorder can be distinguished from culturally accepted posses-\nsion states in that the former is involuntary, distressing, uncontrollable, and often recur-\nrent or persistent; involves conflict between the individual and his or her surrounding\nfamily, social, or work milieu; and is manifested at times and in places that violate the\nnorms of the culture or religion.\n\n\n####",

This disorder may be\ndistinguished from dissociative identity disorder by the absence of an identity disruption\ncharacterized by two or more distinct personality states or an experience of possession.\nDissociative amnesia in conversion disorder is more limited and circumscribed (e.g., am-\nnesla for a non-epileptic seizure).\n\nSelzure disorders. Individuals with dissociative identity disorder may present with sel-\nzurelike symptoms and behaviors that resemble complex partial seizures with temporal\nlobe foci. These include d\u00E9j\u00E0 vu, jamais vu, depersonalization, derealization, out-of-body\nexperiences, amnesia, disruptions of consciousness, hallucinations, and other intrusion\nphenomena of sensation, affect, and thought. Normal electroencephalographic findings,\nIncluding telemetry, differentiate non-epileptic seizures from the seizurelike symptoms of\ndissociative identity disorder. Also, individuals with dissociative identity disorder obtain\nvery high dissociation scores, whereas individuals with complex partial seizures do not.\nFactitious disorder and malingering. Individuals who feign dissociative identity disor-\nder do not report the subtle symptoms of intrusion characteristic of the disorder; Instead\nthey tend to overreport well-publicized symptoms of the disorder, such as dissociative\namnesla, while underreporting less-publicized comorbid symptoms, such as depression.\nIndividuals who feign dissociative identity disorder tend to be relatively undisturbed by\nor may even seem to enjoy \u0022having\u0022 the disorder. In contrast, Individuals with genuine\ndissociative identity disorder tend to be ashamed of and overwhelmed by their symptoms\nand to underreport their symptoms or deny their condition. Sequential observation, cor-\nroborating history, and intensive psychometric and psychological assessment may be\nhelpful in assessment.\n\nIndividuals who malinger dissociative identity disorder usually create limited, stereo-\ntyped alternate identities, with feigned amnesia, related to the events for which gain is\nsought. For example, they may present an \u0022all-good\u0022 identity and an \u0022all-bad\u0022 identity in\nhopes of gaining exculpation for a crime."

  "comorbidity": "Many Individuals with dissociative identity disorder present with a comorbid disorder.

In particular, most develop PTSD. Other disorders that are highly co-\nmorbid with dissociative identity disorder include depressive disorders, trauma- and\nstressor-related disorders, personality disorders (especially avoidant and borderline per-\nsonality disorders), conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder),\nsomatic symptom disorder, eating disorders, substance-related disorders, obsessive-\ncompulsive disorder, and sleep disorders.
