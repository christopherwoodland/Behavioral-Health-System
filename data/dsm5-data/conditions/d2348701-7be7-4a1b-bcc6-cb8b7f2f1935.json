  "diagnosticFeatures": "The essential feature of cyclothymic disorder is a chronic, fluctuating mood disturbance\ninvolving numerous periods of hypomanic symptoms and periods of depressive symp-\ntoms that are distinct from each other (Criterion A). The hypomanic symptoms are of\ninsufficient number, severity, pervasiveness, or duration to meet full criteria for a hypo-\nmanic episode, and the depressive symptoms are of insufficient number, severity, perva-\nsiveness, or duration to meet full criteria for a major depressive episode. During the initial\n2-year period (1 year for children or adolescents), the symptoms must be persistent (pres-\nent more days than not), and any symptom-free intervals last no longer than 2 months\n(Criterion B). The diagnosis of cyclothymic disorder is made only if the criteria for a major\ndepressive, manic, or hypomanic episode have never been met (Criterion C).\nIf an individual with cyclothymic disorder subsequently (i.e., after the initial 2 years in\nadults or 1 year in children or adolescents) experiences a major depressive, manic, or hy-\npomanic episode, the diagnosis changes to major depressive disorder, bipolar I disorder,\nor other specified or unspecified bipolar and related disorder (subclassified as hypomanic\nepisode without prior major depressive episode), respectively, and the cyclothymic disor-\nder diagnosis is dropped.\n\nThe cyclothymic disorder diagnosis is not made if the pattern of mood swings is better\nexplained by schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delu-\nsional disorder, or other specified and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other\npsychotic disorders (Criterion D), in which case the mood symptoms are considered asso-\nciated features of the psychotic disorder. The mood disturbance must also not be attribut-\nable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or\nanother medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism) (Criterion E). Although some individ-\nuals may function particularly well during some of the periods of hypomania, over the\nprolonged course of the disorder, there must be clinically significant distress or impair-\nment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning as a result of the\nmood disturbance (Criterion F). The impairment may develop as a result of prolonged pe-\nriods of cyclical, often unpredictable mood changes (e.g., the individual may be regarded\nas temperamental, moody, unpredictable, inconsistent, or unreliable).\n\n\n##",

    "Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition and depressive disorder\ndue to another medical condition. The diagnosis of bipolar and related disorder due to\nanother medical condition or depressive disorder due to another medical condition is\nmade when the mood disturbance is judged to be attributable to the physiological effect of\na specific, usually chronic medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism). This determination\nis based on the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings. If it is judged that the\nhypomanic and depressive symptoms are not the physiological consequence of the med-\nical condition, then the primary mental disorder (i.e., cyclothymic disorder) and the med-\nical condition are coded. For example, this would be the case if the mood symptoms are\nconsidered to be the psychological (not the physiological) consequence of having a chronic\nmedical condition, or if there is no etiological relationship between the hypomanic and de-\npressive symptoms and the medical condition.\n\nSubstance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder and substance/medica-\ntion-induced depressive disorder. Substance/medication-induced bipolar and related\ndisorder and substance/medication-induced depressive disorder are distinguished from\ncyclothymic disorder by the judgment that a substance/medication (especially stimu-\nlants) is etiologically related to the mood disturbance. The frequent mood swings in these\ndisorders that are suggestive of cyclothymic disorder usually resolve following cessation\nof substance/medication use.\n\nBipolar I disorder, with rapid cycling, and bipolar II disorder, with rapid cycling.\nBoth disorders may resemble cyclothymic disorder by virtue of the frequent marked shifts\nin mood. By definition, in cyclothymic disorder the criteria for a major depressive, manic,\nor hypomanic episode has never been met, whereas the bipolar I disorder and bipolar II\ndisorder specifier \u0022with rapid cycling\u0022 requires that full mood episodes be present.\nBorderline personality disorder. Borderline personality disorder is associated with\nmarked shifts in mood that may suggest cyclothymic disorder. If the criteria are met for\nboth disorders, both borderline personality disorder and cyclothymic disorder may be di-\nagnosed.\n\n\n###"
